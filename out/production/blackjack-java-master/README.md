## Homework:
You can continue working on this project if you like. One feature you can add is create an input to let players bet money (Of course this is hypothetical money!). To do this, you will need a JTextField. Then you can use the getText() method to get the input, check if it's a number, and use that as the amount of money the player is betting. Another useful feature would be to create another JButton for "next game" and enable it only when the game is settled. By clicking this button, your program should call startGame(), which will build and shuffle the deck, and deal new cards to the players.
